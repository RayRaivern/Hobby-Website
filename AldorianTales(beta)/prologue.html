                    A castle far off in the distance in the middle of an open field of grass, that is the sight they were greeted with as they awoke under the shade of a great tree. Their sensation was assailed with countless information, information they were previously used to, and information they had never felt before; the new world overwhelmed them.<br>
                    &ldquo;3 particles; matter, some type of magic, and an odd sensation of reality; does it feel the same for you as well?&rdquo; the man with the glasses asked his comrade, as both of them remained clutching their heads, as they tried to get used to the new feelings.<br>
                    &ldquo;Mana, that was in their database. I don&rsquo;t know about the other one, I can only feel 2.&rdquo; Having finally gotten comfortable, the man with the stout beard covering his chin relaxed his back against the giant tree behind him.<br>
                    &ldquo;Even after all that&hellip;we failed,&rdquo; his voice filled with regret, the man with the glasses thrust his fist onto the ground.<br>
                    &ldquo;Ruing over our own mistakes will get us nowhere. ``The more one laments over his past, the more steps he loses towards gaining a better future&rsquo;,&rdquo; with that answer, the stout bearded man stood up taking the first step forward in a world unfamiliar to both of them.<br>
                    Reluctantly getting up, the man with the glasses followed behind his companion.
