            <div class="box2">
                <span class="c1">A</span><span class="c2">mong the crowds of people walking through roads of the Capital, two people glaringly stood out.<br>&ldquo;Willfred, I am sure you&rsquo;ve already noticed, but it seems our physical form took the shape of the image we had of ourselves while we got registered; our clothes inevitably became custom items, something not of this world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Making us &lsquo;stick out like a sore thumb&rsquo;. There must be a shop somewhere nearby where we can get attire fit for this era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make that our first goal then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I believe that would be our best course of action, Ashton.&rdquo;<br>The otherworldly pair, Willfred and Ashton conversed as they confidently strolled ahead, giving minimal attention to the curious onlookers around them. One might question as to how they even managed to get into the Capital with their conspicuous clothing in the first place, the reason for that laid in the state of the Royal palace at that time; as luck might have it, the pair had entered the Capital at a time when the entire Kingdom went into disarray, an approaching threat that required the immediate attention of the entire continent.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s surprising how perfectly well it fits, yet it doesn&rsquo;t feel odd in the least.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It seems this world is using the same method of clothing the original system had, basically using our consciousness only for fitting; it just overlays the design.&rdquo;<br>Inside a fancy clothing store adhering to royals, the pair Ashton and Wilfred acquired their new outfits. Ashton went with a blue cloak over a black tunic with a white collar, and thick leather pants, while Wilfred&rsquo;s clothing looked more on the lighter side with a white linen shirt on top and common leather pants as his bottom wear.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel hot on that?&rdquo; Wilfred asked as he eyed Ashton&rsquo;s cloak.<br>&ldquo;Just slightly warmer. It gives me the feeling of wearing a lab coat, so I feel more comfortable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hmm, I guess you were always quite persistent with your wardrobe.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The clothing suits the both of you perfectly well, sirs. As for the payment&hellip;,&rdquo; seeing the pair bicker on, the shopkeeper growing impatient proceeded to ask them for the payment.<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately we do not have any cash on us, but will this do for the time being?&rdquo; Wilfred pushed the clothes they were wearing just moments before towards the shopkeeper.<br>This came as a great shock for the shopkeeper that had invited them in, thinking they were men of royalties; he never let the commonwealth step into his shop, but to think he accidentally let two broke man inside and had them wear the shop&rsquo;s expensive attires infuriated him, &ldquo;Are you two out of your mind!? What made you come in here without money to pay for it!?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Before you lose yourself in blind rage, I advise you examine those clothes properly, if you still fail to understand their value, then we can simply leave with them,&rdquo; pointing to their old clothes on the counter, Wilfred urged the shopkeeper in a calm voice. Hearing Wilfred&rsquo;s rational voice, the shopkeeper contemplated for a moment, the clothes the pair were wearing was an extremely curious look, not only were their designs entirely new to him, even their structure felt oddly alien. Picking up the clothes from the counter, the shopkeeper checked their materials and design, closely inspecting them with a monocle he took out of his pocket. <br>&ldquo;T-this is incredible! What fine craftsmanship, and this material, this doesn&rsquo;t feel entirely like cotton or leather! Gentlemen, where did you acquire such fine clothes!?&rdquo;<br>Wilfred felt annoyance from the shopkeeper shouting once again, even if for a different reason.<br>&ldquo;You may keep the clothes and inspect them while we procure the funds for our new garments, but do not damage them, they have value you cannot imagine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;O-of course, you may rest assured.&rdquo;<br>After their successful deal</span><span class="c5">, Wilfred</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;and Ashton stepped outside the shop as they headed towards their next destination. <br>&ldquo;Does our old clothes have any more use to us?&rdquo; Ashton asked Wilfred, questioning the last demand he had made towards the shopkeeper.<br>&ldquo;They hold value, I feel it would be a waste to leave them in a random shop in the city.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; even though he didn&rsquo;t fully understand the value Wilfred saw in the clothes, Ashton still decided that it was best to agree with him.</span></p>
